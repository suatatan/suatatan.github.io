When it comes to working to Microsoft Solutions, at first it looks like you are compulsory to use Microsoft's standard tools. This compulsion not only limits your freedom it also makes kind of consent to 'calamities'.

MS SQLServer does not give a productive environment to the developer. For instance, sometimes you sometimes change your code then execute it, however, the stored procedure or function remains same. If you have not your own copy you would lose all of your efforts.

I have found an open source tool for that: [HeidiSQL](https://www.heidisql.com/). It is super quick and has a lot of features like saving your snippets to a place and very compact tabbed view. It not only works with MS SQLServer, it works with MySQL and PostgreSQL too.

HeidiSQL also provides full text search within the entire database. That is provides very efficiency for big SQL projects.

Enjoy!
