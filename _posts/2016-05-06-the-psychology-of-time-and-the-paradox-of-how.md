Danish philosopher wrote, “the most ridiculous seems to me, to be busy.” —  
Wittmann observes the effects of today’s social and technological  
acceleration on our inner lives:

If one has no time, one has also lost oneself. Distracted by the  
obligations of everyday activities, we are no longer aware of ourselves…  
Everything is done all at once, faster and faster, yet no personal balance  
or meaning can be found. This implies the loss of contact with one’s own  
self. We also no longer feel “at home” with ourselves and find it difficult  
to persist in any given activity because we are available at every moment.
