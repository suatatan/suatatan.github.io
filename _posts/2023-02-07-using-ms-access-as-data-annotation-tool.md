If you have data and need to annotate it one by one, you can use MS Access as a data annotation tool. Well, how?

1- Create new blank database

2- Import your excel as "internal data" to your app it will be table

3- Simply create a "form" from your table

4-Use your form for annotation (navigate with footer navigation buttons -they are very tiny)

5-Export the table after annotation

Here is one sample form from my works. As you see MS access can show dropdowns or checkbox that is very useful tools for annotation.
