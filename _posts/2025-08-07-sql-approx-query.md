# Estimating Row Counts in SQL Server Without COUNT(*)

Working with large datasets in SQL Server often brings a simple question: **"How many rows are in this table?"**

The intuitive solution ‚Äî running `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM my_table` ‚Äî might work fine on small tables. But on **large tables with millions (or billions) of records**, this query can become painfully **slow** and **resource-intensive**, especially if you're querying a production environment.

Luckily, there‚Äôs a much more efficient alternative: `sp_spaceused`.

## üîç Why COUNT(*) Can Hurt Performance

Let‚Äôs quickly understand why `COUNT(*)` is costly:

- SQL Server performs a **full table scan**, especially if there's no optimized index to support the count.
- It can **block or slow down** other operations, especially under high concurrency.
- It's not **instantaneous** ‚Äî it needs to **read every row**.

This is where **approximate counting** becomes essential.

## ‚ö° The Power of `sp_spaceused`

The built-in stored procedure `sp_spaceused` gives you a fast, metadata-based estimate of row count ‚Äî without scanning the entire table.

```sql
EXEC sp_spaceused 'pcmi.ClaimDetails';


This command is for MSSQL but there is equilavent types for other database Technologies too.
