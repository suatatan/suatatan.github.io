"Turn your business ideas into reality with these 5 AI tools Draw to App “Draw to App stands out for its ability to transform real-time drawings into functional applications,” explained Cintas-Canto, who created a currency converter app by sketching it out, all while he was waiting for a flight. Start up Draw to App, enter your OpenAI key, then sketch your concept and hit the build button. “In moments, a fully operational app appears on your phone,” said Cintas-Canto. It’s like living in the future. MORE FOR YOU Tldraw Tldraw is a free, instant, and collaborative diagramming tool that’s enhanced by integrating the GPT-4V API. “This fusion of whiteboard functionality and AI has remarkable capabilities,” explained Cintas-Canto, “such as transforming my basic Pong game sketch into a playable version.” TLdraw’s website invites you to draw a UI then make it real, or sketch an interface, press a button, and get a working website. Follow along as this company builds out the tool. Could an AI app builder create your next business empire? Screenshot-to-Code “The Screenshot-to-Code tool is particularly impressive in its ability to recreate digital interfaces from mere screenshots,” explained Cintas-Canto, who said it flawlessly replicated his X feed interface just from an uploaded image. It then gives you the code (in HTML or Tailwind CSS) so you can play around with it from there, or hand it to a developer. “These tools serve as excellent starting points for developing simple applications or generating foundational code that can be refined or expanded upon with AI assistance,” he added. If you see a feature of another website that you like, use this tool to replicate it for yours. Develop a prototype in a few simple steps. ChatGPT ChatGPT is certainly an AI tool that will accelerate your entrepreneurial journey. Aside from using it to secure press coverage, master productivity, and even create an entire ebook, ChatGPT can help you turn your business idea into a fully functional product. “While ChatGPT doesn’t support live code testing,” said Cintas-Canto, “it can provide code snippets for external testing and serves as both a debugger and a coding assistant,” which can be useful by non-technical people making modifications with added confidence. He recently used GPT-4 for coding and DALL·E 3 for graphics to create a 2D game by asking ChatGPT for the code using natural language, showcasing the significant time savings in developing complex projects. Cursor If you’re on the technical side of business and looking for more advanced AI tools to help you develop in a new way, check out Cursor. “Cursor is an AI-powered code editor that is designed for an AI-first approach to software development,” said Cintas-Canto. “It helps developers write and edit code more efficiently by using AI to provide suggestions, completions, and documentation for various programming languages.” Cintas-Canto, after chatting with his code using the tool, is convinced that AI coding assistants represent the future of programming. Awesome AI tools to go from idea to MVP at speed Cintas-Canto has spent 2023 exploring the potential of AI tools to share the insights with his students, as well as his audience on X. Notable other mentions include Klap App, to turn long videos into short viral videos with AI, Seona to improve SEO, 10Web to create a website with AI, Krea for real time image generation and Runway or Pika Labs for turning images and text into video. With any AI tool, you can’t just sign up and expect miracles. Take the time to understand how they work and provide the best inputs.
