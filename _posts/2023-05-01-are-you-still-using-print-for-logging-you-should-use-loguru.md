Logging is a crucial aspect of software development. It helps developers debug and understand the behaviour of their applications by capturing useful information at runtime. In Python, the standard logging module provides a basic framework for logging, but it can be cumbersome to use and lacks some essential features. This is where Loguru comes in.

[https://loguru.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#readme](https://loguru.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#readme)

## What is Loguru?

Loguru is a Python logging library that simplifies the process of setting up and using logging in Python applications. It provides a simple and intuitive syntax, rich formatting options, and many useful features out of the box.

Some of the key features of Loguru include:

- Automatic configuration of logging settings

- Flexible logging levels and filtering

- Rich formatting options, including colored output

- Convenient file rotation and retention policies

- Easy integration with other Python logging frameworks

## How to Use Loguru

Using Loguru is straightforward. First, install it via pip: pip install loguru Once installed, import it into your Python script and configure it as follows:

```
from loguru import logger
logger.add("file.log", rotation="500 MB", compression="zip")
logger.debug("This is a debug message")
logger.info("This is an info message")
logger.warning("This is a warning message")
logger.error("This is an error message")
logger.critical("This is a critical message")
```

This sets up a file log and configures it to rotate at 500 MB and compress using ZIP format. Then, various log messages are generated at different log levels using the `logger` object.

Loguru also supports more advanced features, such as context variables, function signatures, and exception logging. Check out the [official documentation](https://loguru.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) for more details and examples.

## Why Use Loguru?

Loguru provides a much simpler and more intuitive interface than the standard Python logging module, making it easier to use and learn. It also provides many essential features out of the box, such as file rotation, compression, and filtering, that would otherwise require additional setup with the standard logging module.

Furthermore, Loguru integrates well with other Python logging frameworks, such as Django and Flask, and provides a seamless logging experience across all types of Python applications.

Overall, if you are looking for a better way to handle logging in your Python applications, give Loguru a try!
