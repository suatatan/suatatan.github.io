Since Yandex.Mail shipped i tend to use it because of its clearity, tiny interface and may be feeling of it’s time to try new things.  But i can’t… Because Gmail lock-in effect witholded me. All of my different accounts, and my mails, tags, rules for many years… Yandex announce users with using POP3 strategy to migration. It’s a big mistake becaue requires burn one’s bridges. I just not ready for this. Yandex should change his migration strategy with IMAP3 on webapp in this way he can pull us into Yandex.Mail service.
