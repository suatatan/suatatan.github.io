Iâ€™m developing apps with Google App Engine Python on Ubuntu. I always working with three commands for managing app: run local, update app, and download source code of app. This opeations executing with standard dev\_appserver.py and appcfg.py commands that its very boring.  
I determined writing a bash script for executing this operationgs quickly and without boring. The source codes are below. Copy and paste them, create a document on your desktop gae.sh and paste these codes inside. Then, from terminal, set permissions with:  
chmod +x gae.sh  
and run it  
./gae.sh  
  
This script will ask you smartly for commands. Follow the process
