In R as you know, when it have been written: **summary(lm(x~y))**, the command gives  a lot of different ‘mystic’ values. I have found a good manual for interpreting the result. It is [here](http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/r-lm-summary.html)

Besides, do not forget lm command is relevant with “regression” model. If you want to compute the simple correlation between two parameter use **cor(x,y)** command.

If you do not have any idea about difference, here is [good article](http://www.graphpad.com/support/faqid/1141/) for you

Enjoy
