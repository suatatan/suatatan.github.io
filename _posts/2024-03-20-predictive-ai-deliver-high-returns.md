"Accordingly, predictive AI delivers high returns and improves the customer experience. UPS saves an estimated $35 million annually by optimizing package delivery planning with predictions of tomorrow's deliveries. A medium-sized bank could save $16 million annually by predicting which payment card transactions are fraudulent. A marketing campaign could increase profit by a factor of five by predicting which customers will buy."
