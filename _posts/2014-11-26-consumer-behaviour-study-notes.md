## Define Consumer Behavior?

Consumer Behavior may be defined as **the interplay of forces that takes place during a consumption process, within a consumers** self and his environment.

- this interaction takes place between three elements viz. cogntion, affect and behavior;
    
- it continues through pre-purchase activity to the post purchase experience;
    
- it includes the stages of evaluating, acquiring, using and disposing of goods and services”.
    

## List out the individual determinants and environmental influences that affect consumption behavior?

These are listed as follows:

- Individual Determinants:
    
    - Personal motivation and involvement
    - Perception
    - Attitudes
    - Learning and memory
    - Self-concept and personality
    - Decision making.
- External Environment:
    
    - Family

## Scope of Consumer Behavior:

The study of consumer behavior deals with understanding consumption patterns and behavior. It includes within its ambit the answers to the following:

- ‘What’ the consumers buy: goods and services
    
- ‘Why’ they buy it: need and want
    
- ‘When’ do they buy it: time: day, week, month, year, occasions etc.
    
- ‘Where’ they buy it: place
    
- ‘How often they buy’ it: time interval
    
- ‘How often they use’ it: frequency of use
    

The scope of consumer behavior includes not only the actual buyer but also the various roles played by him/ different individuals.

## Buying Roles

A child goes to a kindergarten school. She comes back home and asks her parents to buy her a set of color pencils and crayons. Now the roles played are: 1. Initiator: the child in nursery school

1. Influencer: a fellow classmate
    
2. Decider: the father or the mother
    
3. Buyer: the father or the mother
    
4. User: the child
    

## Market research may be defined as:

- an organized effort to gather information about the market and the customers.
    
- systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of data related to the market and the surrounding environment.
    

The environment surrounding a Company may be grouped as the “micro-environment” and the “macro environment”. The micro-environment comprises forces in the environment that are close to the company and affect the company directly; for example, the company’s internal environment, the founder/leader and his vision and mission, the customers, competitors, suppliers, and channel intermediaries. The macro- environment on the other hand,comprises forces in the environment that first affect the micro environment and through that they affect the company; in other words they affect the company indirectly; examples are the demographic factors, socio-economic factors, political factors, technological factors, cultural factors, natural factors etc. The forces in the macro environment affect all the companies operating in a same industry in a similar manner.

The micro-environment is studied in terms of strengths (S) and weaknesses (W), while the macro-environment is studied in terms of opportunities (O) and threats(T). The analysis of both of these put together comprises the SWOT analysis.
