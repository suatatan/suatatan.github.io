title: Timing breaks
---

"The key is to plan, and be proactive, about taking breaks. Don't wait until you're mentally shot. Don't wait until you're exhausted. (As the old endurance saying goes, if you wait until you're thirsty to drink, you're already dehydrated.) Whenever possible, plan to take a break every 90 minutes. Decide ahead of time what you will do, and just as importantly, what you won't do.

Because taking periodic breaks matters, but what you do during those breaks -- in terms of boosting focus, clarity, creativity, and productivity -- makes all the difference."
