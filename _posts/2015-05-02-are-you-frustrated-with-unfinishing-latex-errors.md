As a Ph.D. scholar, oftentimes I’m frustrating with Latex caprices with bad boxes,errors, and warnings. As for, basic markdown doesn’t provide a citation option. MSWord is horrible for working long times on the same file because of style and content are as clear as mud.

I discovered [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) today with my friend (@hakanemekci) recommendation. I have just understood that Rmarkdown is “armed markdown”. I like it. 

The best thing is you have not to burn your boats like starting to write in Latex. Knitr library can export markdown as Word, PDF, and HTML painlessly.
