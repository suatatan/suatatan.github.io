title: Human Friendly ASP.MVC Serie
---

As a veteran Python programmer, I am used to coding in the clear and lazy way because Python has not red tape and fantastic overwhelming details. Nowadays I have to code with ASP.MVC 5 with Razor, however.  Gradually, I am coding and learning.  First and foremost attribute of I’ve noticed is ASP.MVC requires a lot of red tape. Especially for type conversations makes me angry. Therefore, I decided to post my experiences as a Python Programmer in ASP.MVC on the “human friendly” way. I branded it “Human Friendly ASP.MVC”.  I will share the codes and advices clearly. I am hating the tradition of sharing plethora of code lines. That is makes readers confused. I will use clear-cut style of python. Do not try to execute, dare to learn…

Here is first:
