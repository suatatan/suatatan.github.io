## Blog & Writing

I have been maintaining this blog for over 15 years, writing more than 700 original articles. This blog represents an open memory that I share with everyone. Through this memory, knowledge gained through countless efforts becomes a permanent memory for both myself and everyone who reads the blog, rather than being forgotten instantly.

The famous writer Borges' definition of paradise applies to me as well: **"I imagine paradise as a very large library."**
