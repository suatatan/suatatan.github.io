This book constitutes a beginning for the R language, which is very easy to learn and apply compared to alternative languages. The book aims for readers to reach a level where they can perform both theoretical and practical applications. Many different readers such as academics, bioinformatics experts, financial analysts, software developers working in or interested in data analysis, or undergraduate and graduate students interested in the field can develop their own statistical or econometric applications with the R language.
